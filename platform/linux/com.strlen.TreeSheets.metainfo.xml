    <p>
      A "hierarchical spreadsheet" that is a great replacement for
      spreadsheets, mind mappers, outliners, PIMs, text editors and small
      databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suitable for any kind of data organization, such as todo lists,
      calendars, project management, brainstorming, organizing ideas, planning,
      requirements gathering, presentation of information, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's like a spreadsheet, immediately familiar, but much more suitable
      for complex data because it's hierarchical.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's like a mind mapper, but more organized and compact.</li>
        <li>It's like an outliner, but in more than one dimension.</li>
        <li>It's like a text editor, but with structure.</li>
    </ul>
